# Holo-UNet: Hologram denoising for low light digital holography

## Installation
The project is written using Keras with a Tensorflow backend. Therefore, an Cuda enabled Nvidia GPU must be available. Jupyter Notebook is used for the example code, and the top block includes the list of required python 3 libraries.

## Data preparation

Training and test data are created in the data_loader.py file. Data is currently not provided due to the size of the files, however interested users can request the data from the authors.

## Training & Testing
For an example of the training and testing process, please see HoloUNet.ipynb.
